# LLM-Cancer-Classification-using-Pathology-text
This project integrates large language models with pathology text data to improve cancer classification. Using NLP techniques such as text preprocessing, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and feature engineering, we enhance clinical decision-making. Machine learning models are trained to improve accuracy and predictions in medical reports.
